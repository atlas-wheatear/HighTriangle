# High Triangle

A chess derivative board-game played upon the surface of a tetrahedron (triangular pyramid). Implemented in the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

## Gameplay

![A screenshot](screenshots/screenshot.png)

There are 2 or 3 armies, consisting of 5 different pieces, 3 of which are familiar from regular, _canonical_ chess: the _pawn_, _knight_ and _rook_ along with the fairy pieces _fers_ and _crown_. The current supported game-mode is _craven_: there is no check or checkmate, the game is over as soon as any crown piece is under attack.
